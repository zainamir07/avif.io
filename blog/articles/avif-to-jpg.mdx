## Introduction

The AV1 image file format is an excellent image file format because of its superior compression properties. They allow for images with smaller file size with excellent visual quality. Unfortunately, it is not supported by many software and hardware solutions. Consequently, it is not surprising that people are looking for tools to convert AVIF to JPG. Several tools are available to help you convert an AVIF file to the more commonly used JPG format.

## Online Converter

### squoosh.app

<Link href="squoosh.app/" text="Link" />

Using Squoosh, you can reduce the size of images by compressing them in various formats. It is possible to reduce the file size of images without sacrificing quality. To do this, open your image and examine the differences, then save it immediately.

With Squoosh, your image is not sent to a server, and the compression process occurs in your web browser. Squoosh is a browser-based PWA that automatically compresses images to your favorite output format. Through WebAssembly, it supports several image formats and processes them client-side in the browser. Therefore, you will be able to keep your pictures on your computer rather than sending them to a remote server. Squoosh is also available while offline.

Google's Squoosh web application is an excellent playground. It is suitable for handling individual images to convert from AVIF to JPG. By experimenting with compression settings, you can compare the output with other file formats and their image size. You have various options for the quality setting of your output JPEG image, including the support for progressive JPEG.

### ezgif.com

<Link href="ezgif.com" text="Link" />

The Ezgif.com website is a free, easy-to-use tool for creating and editing images. You can also perform image editing functions and conversions to other image formats. It supports the WebP Format, Portable Network Graphic, JPEG images, etc., and AVIF support was recently added. A big plus is that EzGif has support for image sequences as well.

Converting to JPG, the tool will allow you to adjust the compression level and set the background color for images with transparency. Once you upload your image in AVIF format, you will find a comprehensive list of options.

<Image src="ezgif-options" alt="Ezgif" />

### cloudconvert.com

<Link href="cloudconvert.com" text="Link" />

CloudConvert is an online tool for converting many types of files like JPEG XR, the HEIF format, or the JPEG format. No software is required to use the tool, and the files are protected from access by anyone except you. They have partnered with several software vendors in addition to using open-source software under the hood. A wide range of conversion types can be tailored to your needs, such as selecting the quality and other options.

<Image src="cloudconvert-finished" alt="Cloudconvert" />

If you upload a file, you will be able to change its dimensions, select quality, and remove metadata.

<Image src="cloudconvert" alt="" />

Unfortunately, the free version of cloudconvert has some limitations regarding its JPG converter. By creating an account, you will be able to bypass their first entry barrier. However, the total number of conversions is still limited to two at a time.

<Image src="cloudconvert-premium" alt="" />

<Image src="cloudconvert-premium2" alt="" />

### cdkm.com

<Link href="cdkm.com" text="Link" />

CDKM provides free AVIF file conversion services among its services for image optimization. Unfortunately, there is a limit to the number of files that can be uploaded. Apart from that, it is an excellent converter with mediocre conversion times. Additionally, you can change the quality of the JPG output and resize the image to suit your needs.

### aconvert.com

<Link href="aconvert.com" text="Link" />

aconvert offers a free avif conversion that supports batch uploads. Strange behavior is that your image filenames are not being preserved. In addition, it provides good conversion speeds and the ability to adjust the output image's quality and size.

<Image src="aconvert-result" alt="" />

<Image src="aconvert" alt="" />

### convertio.co

<Link href="convertio.co" text="Link" />

Convertio was the slowest and most feature-lacking among all converters tested. You do not control your output image, and conversion takes several seconds per file. Dropbox and Google Drive connectivity is an added benefit.

There is a free version and a paid version available. Conversion occurs in the cloud. Uploads are deleted immediately, and converted files are deleted after 24 hours.

<Image src="convertio" alt="" />

### More online solutions

Other solutions are available, but I could not test them error-free and recommend them at this time.

## Software converter

### Filestar

<Link href="filestar.com" text="Link" />

Filestar is a program for converting files and modifying images. Users can convert one or more files, merged, split, transformed, compressed, or extracted with a few clicks. The desktop app offers more than 30 000 skills for any file extension.

<Image src="filestar" alt="" />

The converter is efficient and fast. Filestar works on a step-by-step principle, and every step performs a particular action on your input images.

<Image src="filestar-steps" alt="" />

Filestar is a freemium tool, especially when it comes to batch conversions.

<Image src="filestar-premium" alt="" />

### More online & software solutions

**Pixillion Image Converter**

You can use the Pixillion Image Converter to convert images like AVIF files or a WebP image into other formats. NCH Software created this multimedia program. It lets you convert images in batches, resize images, and even edit your pictures to a certain extent.

Unfortunately, I could not convert any images because error messages appeared indicating that the image dimensions of my AVIF file were too high. This seems odd, considering the photo was 1280 x 720 pixels.

<Image src="pixillion" alt="" />

**reaconverter**

I wanted to give reaconverter a try, but since the download speed of their software was capped at 600kbit/s for whatever reason, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the efficiency of their software. I wouldn't recommend downloading.

<Image src="reaconverter" alt="" />

## CLI Converter

### ImageMagick

<Link href="imagemagick.org" text="Link" />

ImageMagick is a free utility for creating, editing, composing and converting images. It supports over 200 formats. In addition to resizing, flipping, mirroring, rotating, distorting, shearing, and transforming images, ImageMagick can adjust image colors, apply various special effects, and draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses, and Bézier curves.

With version 7.0.25, AVIF image conversion and compression have been natively supported. With the "-define" command-line option, you can specify additional settings for the output JPG file.

<Syntax language="xml">{`magick -quality 75 input.avif output.jpg`}</Syntax>

### Sharp

<Link href="sharp.pixelplumbing.com/" text="Link" />

This Node.js high-performance module converts large images in standard formats into smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF images of varying sizes. Due to the use of libvips, resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings.

All color spaces, embedded ICC profiles, and alpha transparency channels are handled correctly. Resampling by Lanczos ensures that quality is not sacrificed for speed. In addition to image resizing, other options include rotation, extraction, compositing, and gamma correction.

Modern systems running Node.js >= 12.13.0 on macOS, Windows, and Linux do not require additional install or runtime dependencies. For more information, please visit: https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com

<Syntax language="xml">
  {`sharp("bear.avif")
.jpg()
.resize({ width: size })
.toFile("bear.jpg") }`}
</Syntax>

### Squoosh CLI

<Link href="github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli" text="Link" />

We had already discussed Squoosh, but we will discuss the CLI this time. Squoosh v2 was announced at Chrome DevSummit 2020, along with a command-line interface to bring all the codecs of Squoosh to the command line using Node.js and WebAssembly.

By using the CLI's, you can let it choose the codec parameters for you and compress entire folders with a single command. With npx, the Squoosh CLI can be used directly from the command line without installation. If you desire, you may also install the Squoosh CLI. You can find more information on their official Github.

To parallelize the processing of images, the Squoosh CLI uses a worker pool. In this way, Squoosh can encode multiple photos simultaneously with the same codec. Squoosh CLI is not the fastest image compression tool available, and it does not intend to be. Nonetheless, it is fast enough to compress many images simultaneously.

<Syntax language="xml">
  {`squoosh-cli --jpg '{quality: 100}' input.avif`}
</Syntax>

The Squoosh CLI also includes an experimental auto optimizer that compresses an image to the maximum, aiming to achieve a specific Butteraugli target value. As Butteraugli target value increases, the output can introduce more artifacts. Using "auto" as the configuration object will enable you to take advantage of the auto optimizer.

<Syntax language="xml">{`npx @squoosh/cli --wp2 auto test.png`}</Syntax>

Tip: You can test out the web interface and copy the CLI command.

Since the CLI allows for a great deal of automation, it's natural that developers have requested a more conversational interface than programmatically calling the Squoosh CLI via the shell. Ultimately, the goal is to make image compression more accessible to tooling authors.

The inclusion of Webpack, Rollup, and other build tools is a welcome addition to ensure that your images are appropriately optimized for the web. Visit https://web.dev/introducing-libsquoosh for more information.

### Cloudconvert

<Link href="www.npmjs.com/package/cloudconvert-cli" text="Link" />

Cloudconvert's API allows custom integration with your application. Several valuable features are available, including full Amazon S3 integration. The company also provides a command-line interface. With this CLI for the CloudConvert API v2, users will be able to quickly and easily convert files using the terminal. The CLI uses the cloudconvert-node module, which requires Node.js.

## Graphics Editing

While Microsoft Paint can open AVIF images once the AV1 Plugin is installed, you may seek to use other tools. Several graphics editing programs are available that allow you to load and save AVIF files in another format. They may not be your first choice when it comes to converting avif to jpg, but they can be helpful in cases where you wish to edit the images.

### GIMP

<Link href="gimp.org" text="Link" />

GIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor that you can use to manipulate and edit images, perform free-form drawing, convert images between different file formats, and perform more specialized tasks. As a free program, it is available to perform photo retouching, image composition, and image authoring. In many ways, GIMP is similar to Photoshop and is an excellent choice if you seek a free image editor.

<Image src="gimp-jpg" alt="" />

### Krita

<Link href="krita.org/en/" text="Link" />

Krita is an application for creating and manipulating images. Krita is primarily used for painting, illustration, concept art, and other creative tasks. Krita offers both an OpenGL-based canvas and an unaccelerated canvas.

<Image src="krita" alt="" />

### IrfanView

<Link href="irfanview.com" text="Link" />

Among its many functions, IrfanView is an image viewer, editor, organizer, and converter program for Microsoft Windows. In addition, the program can play video and audio files and create and paint images. Commercial use of IrfanView requires a fee. IrfanView is free for non-commercial use. Indeed, third-party tools such as IrfanView may not be as aesthetically pleasing as Windows' photo viewer. Still, they offer greater power, flexibility, and performance than the operating system's default tools.

<Image src="irfanview" alt="" />

### Paint.net

<Link href="getpaint.net" text="Link" />

Paint.NET is an image editing program for computers that are running Windows. The application has a user-friendly interface with support for layers, special effects, and a wide range of valuable and powerful tools. An active online community provides tutorials, assistance, and plugins.

<Image src="paintnet" alt="" />

### XnView MP

<Link href="www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/" text="Link" />

XnView is an excellent image viewer, browser, and converter for Windows. XnView provides numerous ways to browse, organize, and view your images. XnViewMP is a new XnView project, and it stands for Multi-Platform. The same XnView application is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports Unicode in its entirety. The application utilizes multiple processor cores.

## What is AVIF anyways?

From keyframes of the video format AV1, the Alliance for Open Media developed the new image format AVIF in collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org. Netflix has acknowledged that the AVIF image format provides superior image quality in file size compression compared to JPEG, PNG, and WebP. While JPEG has been around for decades, it is time for a new, more advanced alternative. This makes AVIF an exciting development with significant adoption potential.

AVIF can be used in a variety of ways. As a result, it replaces PNG, JPEG, and WebP in images, including photos and graphics. As AVIF files are much smaller than JPEGs, businesses should use them since they can compress several megabytes into bytes without sacrificing any quality. Furthermore, this reduces data consumption and speeds up your website's loading speed, making information more easily accessible and facilitating more conversions.

AVIF support is already present in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Android Browser, and Samsung Internet. Microsoft Edge and Safari are still to follow.

AVIF is not alone. JPEG XL is a raster graphics file format that offers lossless compression and lossy compression. It is designed to outperform existing raster formats and thereby replace them universally.
