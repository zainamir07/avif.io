# avif.io

This Github repo is the source code behind the website [avif.io](https://avif.io). You can use avif.io to convert a wide variety of file formats into AVIF, directly inside your web browser.

<br/>

## Advantages

1. Converted files are never sent to the server
2. The entire conversion process is performed locally
3. Unlimited conversions, even in bulk
4. Flexible and userfriendly interface
5. Options to change quality and effort

<br/>

## How does the conversion work?

We use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) with [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack)
to compile a converter library into WASM and call the Rust code
in the browser, from a WebWorker. The program uses Rust's
[image library](https://crates.io/crates/image) to decode files,
and for encoding to AVIF we use rav1e. The Rust code is in `conversion/`.

# Technical Details

<br/>

## Frontend Code

The root of the project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application
written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).
You can run the application via `npm start`, and watch and reload the
files via `npm develop`. The `wasm-pack`ed Rust code ends up in `public/dist`.

<br/>

## Rust Code

Building Rust requires `cargo` and `make`. To build the wasm
code for release, use:

```bash
cd conversion/
make wasm
```

This will also run webpack to move the produced WASM and JS
files to `public/dist`. Keep in mind that when you clone the repository
the Rust code will already have been compiled, so you don't have to
do this step yourself.

Using make, you can use `make wasm-debug` to build the WASM code
for debugging, or use `make demo-debug` to build a demo binary
to test out the Rust code in a non-WASM environment.

<br/>

## WebP

At the time of writing, the `image` library hasincomplete
support for the WebP format. Instead, we use a special build of
[libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/) called webp_js,
which allows us to decode WebP files in the browser using the
canvas web API. This is important to keep in mind — WebP handling
is a special case at the moment, so don't be surprised that some
of the code is explicitly checking whether it's working with WebP.
